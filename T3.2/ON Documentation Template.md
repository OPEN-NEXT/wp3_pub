**Open Next Project Template**

## Before you start

This **Open Next Project Template** is available for you and your team to **follow as reference** in the process of uploading your Project to the **any platform** You can also work from this Template to develop your own. 

To reference this template, you can answer the questions in each section in your own Project's readme. Read this **[support material/links]()**.

You can even *download* this template and upload it on the platform of your choice. This can be useed as a base for your documentation. 

**Using Files inside your Project for your Documentation**

Remember that you can always upload all the design and information files here **[support material/links]()**

**Prompting feedback and tasks with Issues/community interaction** 

The ? section is where you can get the feedback you need related to your Project directly. **[support material/links]()**

### ✔️**Additional Tips**

1. Share early and sharing often because in whatever stage you are at you can involve others to contribute and help you move forward.
2. Don't forget to contribute so your teammates can see your changes in the project! Read this **[support thread on the importance of Contributing](https://wikifactory.com/+wikifactory/forum/category/NjU?thread=MTkzMzY0)**.
3. Every folder can have a Readme file, so you can organise information more granularly as well. Read this **[support thread on how to use sub-Readme's inside folders](https://wikifactory.com/+wikifactory/forum/category/NjU?thread=MTkzMzU2https://wikifactory.com/+wikifactory/forum/category/NjU?thread=MTkzMzU2)**.

## **ABOUT YOUR PROJECT**

- What is the general idea of your project?
- For whom is your project designed or made for?
- What prior work inspires you to develop your project?

## **THE PROBLEM**

- What is the problem or need that your Hardware or Product Design is for?
- How is it better than the alternative? Is it cheaper, more accesible, more appropriately designed?
- What is the unique value proposition?

## **PROJECT VIABILITY**

- How do you intend to test and measure how effectively your Hardware or Product Design meets the needs or problem you intend to solve?
- What is your plan that will make your Project:
    - economically sustainable
    - scalable business model
    - desirable and accessible to the intended end user
- At what stage is your Project at and what proof do you have about the viability?

## **THE TEAM**

- Who are you? Tell us a little bit about your team members and your background. 
- Do you have all the skills covered?
- What skills are you looking for?
- How long have you been working on this project and where?

## **THE BILL OF MATERIALS**

- List the materials and components that were used in this project so far. Where the choice of materials or components was for the purpose of arriving at the first prototype, you can make note of what the Product would *ideally* be made with.
- What was the total cost of all your materials, components and supplies? For one unit or initial batch?

## **THE MACHINES & PARTS**

- What machines or tools did you use to make your prototype(s)? (3D printer, CNC, laser cutter?)
- Do you know the settings of the machines or tools?
- What machines do you think will be needed moving forward?
- What fabrication materials are needed?

## **ABOUT THE DESIGN**

- Show the process from ideation to the final design. What kind of design techniques did you use to develop this project? Do you have any original sketches or 3D designs that show how your design has evolved?
- ?Embed your 3D files directly into your Readme either by referencing a file you have uploaded to your Project already, or by embedding a 3D file from your desktop already. **[Read this story about how to Embed a File throughout Wikifactory.](https://wikifactory.com/+wikifactory/stories/introducing-the-file-finder-and-embeds)**
- Explain the different parts of the design if there are multiple design components. 
- Make sure to share your design files in ??formats

## ELECTRONICS AND PROGRAMMING (To include if your project has an electronics component)

- What electronics or programming is needed? 
- Describe here the process of compiling the electronics and what programming is required. 
- Could you include a sketch of your board? Ideally, you also include the source code.

## **ABOUT THE PROTOTYPE**

- How did you prototype your project? Make sure the electronics are added onto the BOM as well
- Do you have videos or photos to show for the different iterations?
- Demonstrate the workflows used and as much about the process of ideation to design to physical prototype. It's a good idea to include the problems you faced and how you fixed it.

## **POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS**

- How do you intend to improve this project?
- What you would do different from the first prototype towards the final product?
- What would you like to achieve with your project in the next year?

## **Include any additional information in the Drive.**

Please include any additional information, files or documentation that you would like us to consider inside the Files section of your Project.
