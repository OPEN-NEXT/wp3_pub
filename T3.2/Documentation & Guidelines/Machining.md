Pre-machining
Here are a list of details which would help other manufacture your design:
- Material used
- Recommended dimension in terms of lenght, breadth and height
- Settings of the machines you used
  -speed
  -temperature 
  -power
  -frequency 
- Model of your machine
- The code used/ the image used
- Software used for the code/image

Others might use another machine, hence you could provide some general ranges which could work for your design
- Alternative materials which can be used
- Range of settings which would work
