From the raw material to the final finishing of machining process there are multiple steps which usually need to be followed.
So that everyone knows how it needs to be manufactured here is a checklist for the same:

- Copy and paste this list for every part that needs to be manufactured
- Raw material
  - Size (Length, width, height), material/properties (material name and grade), alternative materials
- First process 
  - Process name
  - Process parameters 
    - Dimensions
    - Machine parameters (For: [Turning](https://technologicalprocess.com/turning-selection-of-machining-parameters/), Grinding, Milling, Drilling, Tapping)
- Second process
- Third process
