# Contribution Guideline

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Thank the contributor for having chosen the project to help.

Tell them how excited you are to have them as a part of your team.

Here are a few tips and tricks to help you contribute on the project:

Step 1: How to find a problem/request that you can help us with
- Where can problems/requests be found? (e.g. github issues, forum, website, slack, documentation- section x)
- Provide links to where they can be found
- If there are multiple locations then please explain what type of problems/requests can be found where, and how to work with them
  - [Issues](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp3_pub/blob/master/T3.2/Documentation%20%26%20Guidelines/Contributing%20through%20forks) 
  - Slack

Step 2: If there is a need to register or login to access and contribute?
- Explain where and how to do that

Step 3: Describe what each of them are and how to work with the different types 
- For e.g. with issue boards - define the common terms and how to work with the same (link to procedures)
- How you can assign yourself to the same

Step 4: Make sure the contributors know your wishes and requests
- Licenses - provide a link to read up on the license
- Type of documentation required - Provide a link to the basics rules/ or a template of how the documentation should look like
- Color scheme 
- Modularity rules, etc.

Note to the project owner:
- Make sure the documentation is suitable for different groups of people with diverse knowledge
- Consider providing useful links to provide more related information 
- Maybe also name or try to connect with them personally to get them further involved


In this documentation you will learn how to contribute for an open source project

* Find a project
* Prepare a fork
* (types of contributions) Contribution process: -- Sources -- Submitting bugs -- Contributing changes
* 

You can also:

* Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
* Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
* Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF


## Find a project or issue to contribute

Open source project platforms and communities can very in different aspects, like the vocabulary, norm, communication style. Despite that they follow a similar organizational structure. The involved figures and their roles are as follows:

* Author: The person/s or organization that created the project
* Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
* Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
* Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project
* Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction
* Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.

Every open source project you would find, mostly will have documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.

* LICENSE: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.
* README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.
* CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
* Other documentation: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects. Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.

There are also other communication options to discuss, review or share the related issues.

* Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.
* Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress. (**how to trigger it is missing)**
* Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.
* Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.
* **Website of the project itself**
